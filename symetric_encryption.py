"""
Steps:

Import Fernet
Then generate an encryption key, that can be used for encryption and decryption.
Convert the string to a byte string, so that it can be encrypted.
Instance the Fernet class with the encryption key.
Then encrypt the string with the Fernet instance.
Then it can be decrypted with Fernet class instance and it should be instanced with the same key used for encryption.
